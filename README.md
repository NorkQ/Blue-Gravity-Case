# Blue-Gravity-Case

All the codes in the project writed by me. But I have used some of my old systems. These are Pipoza package in Assets/3rdParty/Pipoza, UI System and Money System in Assets/GameSystems/. In UI System, just UIManager and UIBase comes from my old projects.

<h3>Pipoza Package</h3>

<p>This package has some basic tools to increase efficiency like KdTree, Singleton, SingletonScriptableObject, Dictionary Serialization and Transform Extensions. We can create <strong>game system folders</strong> and <strong>config files</strong> easily. To create a system config, I am creating a config script first by using script templates. After create the config script, I create the config file from /Create/Pipoza/Config/Config Name. I don't use public or serializefield in scripts to not make inspector complicated. Instead, I store all serializable fields in config window and acces it from script. You can acces to config window from <strong>/Window/Pipoza/Config Window</strong>. Also to create a game system folder -> /Create/Pipoza/Game System Folder and rename it.</p><br>

<h3>Game Systems</h3>
<p>Every game system has own files like scripts, models, textures. This way is like better for me when develop advanced games</p>

<h3>Character Changes</h3>
<p>Main character was different and more suitable for this theme. But I couldn't find a package with clothes and animations for this type of game. I tried to pay it but itch io only accepts paypal and paypal is not available in Turkey. So I changed the main character.
